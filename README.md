# DRP2023

#### This repository contains the code from my introduction to machine learning through the Spring 2023 Stony Brook Math Directed Reading Program (DRP) with my mentor, Dan Waxman. Currently included is neural_network.py, my assisted implementation of a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.
